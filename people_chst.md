Charlotte started working with Emma Lundberg already in 2008 as the first PhD student in the lab. As a PhD student she developed methods for high throughout sub cellular profiling using immunofluorescence which are today used in the Cell Atlas. Since 2017 she is leading the national [Cell profiling Facility] (https://elastic-boyd-26b21f.netlify.com/facilities.html), that performs custom made immunofluorescence experiments to academia and industry.
