Emma is Professor in cell biology proteomics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and Director of the Cell Atlas, part of the Human Protein Atlas program. She is currently spending two sabbatical years as visiting Associate Professor at Stanford School of Medicine and the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub. In the interface between bioimaging, proteomics and artificial intelligence her research aims to define the spatiotemporal organization of the human proteome at a subcellular level, with the goal to understand how variations and deviations in protein expression patterns can contribute to cellular function and disease. She also has an interest in the use of gaming for science and health applications.
