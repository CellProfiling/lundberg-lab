Through various measures we try to engage a wider community in our work. For example through a Citizen Science project called [Project Discovery] (https://www.eveonline.com/discovery) for classification of protein patterns in microscope images, integrated into the massively multiplayer online Sci-Fi game Eve Online with over 300.000 participants, and through the Kaggle Challenge [Human Protein Atlas Image Classification Challenge] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification).
