You have reached Cell Profiling website!  Cell profiling is responsible for the creation of the Human Protein Atlas - Cell Atlas: (i) Determine the subcellular distribution of proteins using high-resolution confocal microscopy, (ii) validation of antibody specificity using gene editing and silencing technologies (iii) annotation and knowledge- based curation of subcellular distribution profiles in the Cell Atlas.

But the group is much more indeed! There is a research group focused on spatial proteomics and cell biology, always looking for new opportunities to engage a wider community in our work.

An there is even more! Cell Profiling facilties enables researchers to access the resources and expertise from the Human Protein Atlas.

Welcome again and we hope you will join browing our website!
