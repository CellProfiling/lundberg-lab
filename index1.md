You have reached Cell Profiling website!  Cell profiling is responsible for the creation of the Human Protein Atlas - Cell Atlas: it determines the subcellular distribution of proteins using high-resolution confocal microscopy, validates antibody specificity using gene editing and silencing technologies and makes annotation and knowledge-based curation of subcellular distribution profiles in the Cell Atlas.

But the group is much more indeed! There is a research group focused on spatial proteomics and cell biology, always looking for new opportunities to engage a wider community in our work.

An there is even more! Cell Profiling facilties enables researchers to access the resources and expertise from the Human Protein Atlas.
