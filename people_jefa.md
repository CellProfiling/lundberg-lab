Jenny grew up in Norrk√∂ping and moved to Stockholm in 1995. She has quite a different background compared to other groupmembers, as she has a musical career beside the work in Lundberg lab. Jenny is working as a lab technician and does most of the cell culturing and the manual aquisition on the confocal microscopes for the production of the [Cell Atlas] (https://elastic-boyd-26b21f.netlify.com/cellatlas).
