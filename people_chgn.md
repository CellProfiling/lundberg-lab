### Christian Gnann
christian.gnann@scilifelab.se 

Christian made it from a small village deep down in Southern Germany into the cold, unforgiving European north in 2015, where he joined the CellProfiling group as a Bachelor student. However, he quickly noticed that Stockholm was an amazing place to live and work so Christian stayed around as a Research Engineer (and PhD student). Most of his time goes into the work with cellular heterogeneity. 
But if there is some free time he tries his best to tick stuff off his life goal bucket list (ChristianÂ´s personal highlights are writing a children's book and working on a stand up comedy program).
