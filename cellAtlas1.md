The [Human Protein Atlas] (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) is a Swedish-based program initiated in 2003 with the aim to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues and organs using integration of various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics and systems biology. All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome. The Human Protein Atlas consists of three separate parts, each focusing on a particular aspect of the genome-wide analysis of the human proteins; the Tissue Atlas showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and organs in the human body, the Cell Atlas showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells, and finally the Pathology Atlas showing the impact of protein levels for survival of patients with cancer. The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications in the field of human biology and disease and it is selected by the organization ELIXIR (www.elixir-europe.org) as a European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community. The Human Protein Atlas consortium is funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

The [Cell Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/cell) creation is part of our work providing high-resolution insights into the spatio-temporal distribution of proteins within human cells. The protein localization data is derived from antibody-based profiling by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, using a panel of 64 cell lines to represent various cell populations in different organs and tissues of the human body. In this cell line panel the mRNA expression of all human genes are characterized using deep RNA-sequencing. The subcellular distribution of each protein is then investigated in a subset of cell lines selected based on corresponding gene expression, and classified into 33 different organelles and fine subcellular structures. The Cell Atlas currently covers [12073] (https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/has_protein_data_in:cell) genes (62%) for which there are available antibodies. It offers a database for exploring details of individual genes and proteins of interest, as well as systematically analyzing transcriptomes and proteomes in broader contexts, in order to increase our understanding of human cells.
