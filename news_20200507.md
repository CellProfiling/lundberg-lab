*In March 2020, SciLifeLab launched a national call for researchers nationwide, to create a comprehensive program to combat the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 285 proposals were submitted, with applicants ranging from Swedish universities and hospitals, and other organizations both in Sweden and abroad. The SciLifeLab management group reviewed all proposals and approved 67 for funding. The funded  applications are grouped in 9 research areas. The projects will be funded with a total of 50 MSEK from Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. Furthermore, the SciLifeLab board has allocated 12 MSEK to coordinating the program and connecting it with the SciLifeLab infrastructure, to further strengthen the effects of the initiative.*
