*The Cell Profiling Facility at SciLifeLab now offers highly multiplexed imaging using the CODEX (Co-Detection by indEXing) platform. The technology allows for detection of more than 50 proteins in the same tissue section at single cell resolution with quantitative data of each and every protein. Since 2018 the Cell profiling Facility, together with Prof Emma Lundberg, was part of the CODEX early access program. Now, the technology is available as a service to the research community.*
